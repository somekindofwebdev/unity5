TODO
1. Show active - done
2. Update contact - done
3. Validation https://codeigniter.com/user_guide/incoming/controllers.html

5. Tidy code - comment everything
6. Styling


PROCESS
1. Read up on CodeIgniter
2. Install and configure
3. Start ContactController - just returning list of contacts as static JSON
4. Stub ContactModel
5. Start view
6. Create database
7. Implement ContactModel - return list of contacts from db
8. Complete View
9. Begin Show Active - got stuck
10. Implement Update route
11. Implement Create route
12. Host working but incomplete version, including database
13. Push to GitHub
14. Read up on CodeIgniter Validation - poss to use with AJAX?
15. Finish Show Active
16. Fix add/update
17. Start on validation
18. Validation failed (ahahaha) - write manually
19. Error handling

REMEMBER
1. Hosting - upload everything except .git and Database.php
2. Switch to production mode

BUGS
1. Don't click a contact, but type a new one in, add, and then update.  Updates contact with contact_id = 1 - fixed
2. Click a contact, overwrite details, add, then update.  Updates contact with id = the one you selected, not the new one - fixed
3. Clicking contact needs to find by ID, not array index - fixed
4. contact not set at startup - fixed
5. Active status not reading/writing to db

LEARNING
1. CodwIgniter validation requires FormData!  Changing now would mean refactoring a lot of code
